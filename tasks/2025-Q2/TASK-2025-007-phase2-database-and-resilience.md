## Description
This epic focuses on making the application robust and observable. It involves integrating the MS SQL Server database for state management and logging, implementing failure notifications, and adding a configurable retry mechanism to the executor.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   All task runs and their logs are persisted to the database.
*   The executor automatically retries failed tasks according to the robot's configuration.
*   An email notification is sent when a task fails permanently.
*   The user can check the status of tasks and re-run failed tasks via new CLI commands.

## Definition of Done
*   All child tasks (TASK-2025-008 to TASK-2025-013) are completed and marked as 'done'.
*   A failed task can be demonstrated to trigger the retry logic and send a notification.
