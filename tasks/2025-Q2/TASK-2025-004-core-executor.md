## Description
Implement the initial version of the Robot Executor in `src/vibe_python/executor.py`. This version will focus on translating a robot's action list into `pyautogui` calls.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   An `executor.py` module is created.
*   It contains a function that accepts a Pydantic `Robot` object.
*   The function iterates through the robot's `actions` list and executes them using `pyautogui`.
*   This initial implementation does not need to include retry logic or database integration.

## Definition of Done
*   The executor function is implemented and can successfully run a simple, hardcoded robot definition.
