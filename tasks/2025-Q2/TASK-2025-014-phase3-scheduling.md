## Description
This epic covers the implementation of automated task scheduling and turning the application into a long-running, manageable service.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The application can automatically queue robot tasks based on cron schedules in their configuration files.
*   A CLI command (`start-service`) exists to run the application as a persistent service.
*   A CLI command (`restart-service`) exists to gracefully restart the service to apply configuration changes.

## Definition of Done
*   All child tasks (TASK-2025-015 to TASK-2025-017) are completed and marked as 'done'.
*   A scheduled task can be demonstrated to run automatically at its configured time.
