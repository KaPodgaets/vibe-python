## Description
Establish the initial project directory structure and set up the dependency management file (`pyproject.toml`). This task lays the groundwork for all subsequent development.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The project directory structure (including `src/vibe_python`, `configs/robots.d`, `scripts`, `tests`) is created as defined in the architecture plan.
*   A `pyproject.toml` file is created.
*   Core dependencies (`typer`, `pydantic`, `python-dotenv`, `pyautogui`, `SQLAlchemy`, `pyodbc`) are added to the dependency list.

## Definition of Done
*   The new directory structure exists in the repository.
*   The `pyproject.toml` file is committed.
