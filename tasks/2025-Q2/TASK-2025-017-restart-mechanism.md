## Description
Create a reliable mechanism for restarting the service to apply configuration changes. This involves using a process ID (`.pid`) file and a helper script.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The `start-service` command is updated to write the current process ID to a `.pid` file.
*   A helper script (e.g., `scripts/restart.bat`) is created that reads the PID, stops the process, and starts a new one.
*   A `vibe-python restart-service` CLI command is implemented that executes this helper script.
