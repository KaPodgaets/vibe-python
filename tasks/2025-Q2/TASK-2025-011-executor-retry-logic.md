## Description
Enhance the `Executor` to be resilient to transient failures by implementing an automated retry mechanism.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The executor reads the `on_failure` policy (`retries`, `delay_seconds`) from the robot's configuration.
*   The task execution is wrapped in a loop that respects the number of configured retries.
*   A delay is introduced between retry attempts.
