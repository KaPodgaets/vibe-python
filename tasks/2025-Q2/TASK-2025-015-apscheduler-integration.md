## Description
Implement the `Scheduler` component in `src/vibe_python/scheduler.py`. This component will use `APScheduler` to read robot configurations and schedule jobs.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   `APScheduler` is added as a dependency.
*   The `Scheduler` component is created.
*   On startup, the scheduler reads all robot configs and, for each enabled robot, schedules a job based on its cron expression.
*   The scheduled job's only action is to call the DAL to create a 'Pending' task in the database.
