## Description
Implement a mechanism within the `Executor` to prevent the RDP session from locking or activating a screensaver during periods of inactivity between tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The `Executor` includes a method that, when active, performs a small, non-disruptive action (e.g., minor mouse movement) periodically.
*   This mechanism is only active when the application is running in service mode.
